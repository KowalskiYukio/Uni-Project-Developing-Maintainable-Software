# DMS Coursework - Hilman Hazizi

<b>Project Title:</b> Snake<br>
<b>Author:</b> Hilman Hazizi

This project is the classic Snake game that I have carried out maintenance on from the base code that was given. Several features have also been added such as a Main Menu, Pause Menu, and Fail Screen.

## Installation Guide

1. Open a terminal at a location of your choice (this will be where you launch the game from).
2. Type `git clone https://projects.cs.nott.ac.uk/psyhh6/dms-coursework-hilman-hazizi.git`
3. Press enter (you may have to enter your git credentials).
4. Open IntelliJ IDEA, then click "Open Project" and navigate to where you cloned the project.
5. Click on the folder named `DMS Coursework - Hilman Hazizi`. Be aware that this is **NOT** the same folder as `dms-coursework-hilman-hazizi`. Click "OK".
6. Go to Project Structure (Press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S).
7. Under Project Settings > Project, make sure the SDK is JDK 21.
8. If you have not downloaded JDK 21, select "Download JDK..." from the SDK dropdown and download the correct JDK version.
9. From the Project tool window, go to `src/main/resources`, right-click the fonts folder, then click Open in > Explorer.
10. From your file explorer, open the OTF file and install the font.
11. From the Project tool window, go to `src/main/java/main/Play.java`. This file should be opened.
12. Run the current file (which should be `Play.java`).
13. If an error occurs, go to `src/main/java/entity/Snake.java`, comment (or remove) Line 161, then uncomment line 164.

## How to Play

Move the snake using the arrow keys. You can pause the game using the Esc button.
